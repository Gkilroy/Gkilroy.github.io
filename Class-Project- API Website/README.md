 Project Description;
 This is a website with a search engine that uses GIPHY's API key to query a gif from any search keyword
 you simply type in a word that you would like to see a giphy of and it will return 5 gifs of that word you typed in

 Technologies used;
 *API key
 *.html
*.css 
*.scss
*.js

Future ideas;
make the nav bar connect to other sites
pull more than 5 gifs at once
have a randomize button that will search on click with the most popular gifs
add options to copy to clipboard or follow link to origin
